# NCEAS-geospatial-python

The main purpose of this repo is to house code related to some tasks outlined in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HHFwNG6fuDos9cv6_fHiemI0tjQelOM2q5Ed3xt2EJU/edit). First up, is to create a scripted version of [this species distribution data set](https://github.nceas.ucsb.edu/NCEAS/sasap-bio/issues/26). It was created with GUI GIS, but we'd like the analysis scripted and repeatable. I've created a [project](https://github.com/scottbmortensen/NCEAS-geospatial-python/projects/1) to keep track of issues related to this species distribution task.
